                <p>Tive o prazer de trabalhar por quase dois anos com o Yan. Trabalhamos juntos na mesma equipe e logo percebi a facilidade que ele tem de se relacionar com as pessoas, de buscar aprender e o compromisso com as entregas. Recomendo o Yan pelas habilidades como desenvolvedor e gestor de projetos.</p>
